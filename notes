Goal: Make a neural network to recognise mnist images from scratch with minimal inputs

Weights are multiplied as you go down the net. If output1 is connected to input1 and input2, it's value is input1 * weight1_1 + input2 * weight2_1
representing weights as weightinput_output
biases are added onto the calculated output.


Need an activation function.
An activation function makes the output of each node standard - for example, for the sigmoid function, it is between 0 and 1.
